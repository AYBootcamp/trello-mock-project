# Trello Front-end Technical Specifications

## Summary
This document outlines the technical specifications for the revamp of Trello's front-end interface. The new interface aims to enhance user experience and improve load times across devices.

## Background
Given the feedback regarding the slow load times and less than optimal user experience on certain devices, a revamp of the front-end interface is required.

The current project aims to address the following problems:
- Slow load times of the Trello interface across various devices.
- User experience is currently sub-optimal, requiring improvements in design and interactivity.

## Goals
Through this implementation, we aim to:
- Improve load times of Trello on all devices.
- Enhance user experience through interface redesign and better interactivity.
- Develop a more maintainable and scalable front-end architecture.

## Non-Goals
While revamping the front-end, the following are not within the scope of our project:
- Adding new features to Trello.
- Authenticate and Authorization.

## Details
Our engineering approach involves:
- Write frontend specifications.
- Set up project: 
  1. Use create-react-app to setup basic development environment.
  2. Setup the Trello frontend project codebase.
  3. create a folder in GitHub under frontend/zihe
- Adopting React, Redux and Routing as our primary front-end libraries for developing the user interface.
- Design UI details including Board Overview, Card Detail View and Filter Panel View.
  
Further details and illustrations will be provided as we proceed with the individual features.

## Other considerations
Considerations include:
- Regular performance testing is required during the development phase to ensure we are meeting our load time goals.
- The new interface must adhere to Accessibility Guidelines.

## Open questions
- Do we need to hire additional front-end developers to complete this project?
